# ðŸ–© Pocket (v. 0.0.1)
Pocket is a strange idea that I currently have, I have no idea if it will work.

## So whats up?
Pocket is taking some of the nicer parts of django such as the ORM and attemping to make them useful inside a Flask microservice architecture.

## Why?
*Boredom*

## Installation
1. Clone this puppy!
2. Create a virtual environment (eg. 'python -m venv' or 'virtualenv' and run `python setup.py develop`

## Usage
3. Run `python pocket/app.py`
